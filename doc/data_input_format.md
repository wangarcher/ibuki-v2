# Humanoid Simulation Model Input Format

## Coordination Frame
There are 47 degrees of freedom and _ main joints in ibuki-v2. 

The coordination frame of each joint is set as follows. 

**Note: The axis which face you is Y axis, and all of the directions of the rotations obeys the following coordination frame.**

**the direction which is the same with the coordinate frame is marked as +1(positive direction). Otherwise, it is marked as -1(negative direction)**

**For example, when ibuki faces you, the neck looks the right side of the image, the direction is +1**

## Simulation Model Initial Posture and Joint Mapping of Ibuki
### Simulation Model Initial Posture
Note that the ibuki is lack of some joints comparing with the simulation model. When generating input files, these effects should be considered.
**RA1 and RA0 should be considered as one rigid, there is only one joint between N0N1N2.**

### Joint Mapping
The joints of ibuki and their array SNs has been shown in the below table. 
To map your simulation model joints with ibuki's joints, do as follows:

* Look at the Initial Posture graph, remember the name of the joint (e.g. **ARMR_MIDDLE**)
* Decide the orientation. (e.g. **PITCH**). 
* Combine the name and the orientation together with `_+<name>+_+<orientation>`. (e.g. **_ARMR_MIDDLE_PITCH**)
* Check the table below and find the array SN. 

**Note: you may not find your joint in the table below, such as _ARMR_MIDDLE_ROLL. This is because ibuki does not have this DoF. If this happens, please fix that DOF to constant.**

**Note: For those name do not end with ROLL, PITCH, YAW(mostly in head parts), they end with the actual meanings of the part. Please match it according to the actual situations.**

## Input Data Format
### .csv file 
Download [https://github.com/ustyui/ibuki-v2/blob/master/doc/data_format.csv] for better understanding.

### ibuki jointname
1st row. **Don't edit**.
### Time (s)
1st column. Please keep the time intervals bigger(or equals to) than 0.02s.
### Unit(degree) of the value 
This .csv file use **rad** as input value. 

**Current rad apart from the initial posture** is needed.

for example, if _ARMR_MIDDLE_PITCH rotates for +0.5 rad from the initial posture, then element for this line should be `line[12+1] = 0.5`. It is recommended to keep the numbers within 5 digits (e.g. 0.1234).
### Direction of the value
Please refer to the coordination frame above.

In the coordinate frame, 

the direction the same with the arrow (**unclockwise towards the postive axis**) is positive direction.
In this case, you should input your value as a positive value.

the direction the same with the arrow (**unclockwise towards the postive axis**) is negative direction.
In this case, you should input your value as a negative value.
