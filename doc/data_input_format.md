# Humanoid Simulation Model Input Format

## Coordination Frame
There are 47 degrees of freedom and _ main joints in ibuki-v2. 

The coordination frame of each joint is set as follows. **Note that the rpy is refering to when you face the frontside of ibuki.**

## Simulation Model Initial Posture and Joint Mapping of Ibuki
Note that the ibuki is lack of some joints comparing with the simulation model. When generating input files, these effects should be considered.
